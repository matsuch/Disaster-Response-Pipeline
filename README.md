## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is part of the Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with figure Eight. The dataset contains pre-labelled tweet and messages from real life disaster events. The aim is to design a model to categorize massages on all 36 pre-defined categoties that can be sent to the appropriate disaster relief agency.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3 with the following libraries: 
  - Machine Learning: NumPY, Scipy, Pandas, sklearn
  - Natural Language Process: NLTK
  - SQLite Database: SQLalchemy
  - Model Loading and Saving: Pickle
  - Web App and Data Visualization: Flask, Plotly

## Installation Instructions <a name="installation"></a>

1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- **Data**
  - disaster_categories.csv + disaster_messages.csv - *Datasets with all the necessary informations*
  - process_data.py - *Code that reads and cleans the csv files and stores it in a SQL database.*
  - db_disaster_messages.db - *Dataset created after the transformed and cleaned data from the disasters CSV files.*
- Models
  - train_classifer.py - *Code necessary to load data and run the machine learning model.*
  - classifier.pkl - *Pickle file from the train_classifer code.*
- App
  - run.py - *Flask app and the user interface used to predict results and display them.*
  - templates - *Folder containing the html template files*

Below are the accurancy and the execution time that I found for the 3 tested pipeline in the **ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb**

**Main():**
- Accurancy: 94.2736
- Executation time: 76.71 seconds

**Main_boosted():**
- Accurancy: 94.1286
- Executation time: 135.15 seconds

**Main_boosted_2():**
- Accurancy: 94.3261
- Executation time: 873.03 seconds

Feel free to change the the **build_model()** function in the **train_classifier.py** file (models folder)
